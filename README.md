## How to Put It Online (Deploy)

This project is easily deployable online with **GitHub Pages** since it is comprised solely of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

1.  **Put your primary `index.html` file in the root directory of your project folder.**
2.  **Push your project files to your GitHub repository's `main` branch:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit of Food Ordering project"
```
git push origin main
    ```
    *(If you wish to deploy from a `gh-pages` branch, you would push to `gh-pages` instead of `main` after committing.)*

3.  **Set up GitHub Pages:**
    * Navigate to your repository on GitHub using your web browser.
    * Click the **Settings** tab.
* In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
    * Under "Build and deployment," choose **Branch** for the "Source."
    * Select `main` (or `gh-pages` if you pushed to that branch) as the branch to deploy from.
    * Ensure the folder is set to `/ (root)`.
    * Click **Save**.
* Your site should then be accessible at a URL such as `https://Yuvarajauvs.github.io/YourFoodOrderingRepoName/` (substitute `YourFoodOrderingRepoName` with the actual name of *this* particular GitHub repository).
